Pdf Aether - "Unlock Insights, Instantly" ðŸŒŒ

Pdf Aether is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot designed to unlock deep insights from complex PDFs. Powered by LLaMA 3.2 and LangChain, and hosted on Streamlit, this project combines the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with efficient, vector-based retrieval via Qdrant to make document analysis fast, scalable, and highly interactive.

Project Overview

Pdf Aether aims to simplify the process of navigating dense, data-heavy PDFs like legal documents, research papers, and financial reports. Built to transform unstructured information into actionable insights, Pdf Aether leverages the power of Generative AI to answer detailed, context-rich queries.

Key Features

Instant Document Understanding: Processes large PDFs (up to 200MB) and extracts meaningful insights, making it suitable for use cases in finance, law, research, and beyond.
Efficient Search & Retrieval: With Qdrant (running in a Docker container) for vector-based retrieval, Pdf Aether quickly surfaces contextually relevant information, allowing for precise and relevant answers.
Generative AI-Powered Responses: Integrates RAG architecture with LLaMA 3.2 and LangChain to combine data retrieval and natural language responses, turning complex data into clear, digestible information.

How It Works

User Query: Enter a question or query related to the content of the PDF.
Data Retrieval: Qdrant performs vector-based retrieval to find the most relevant sections of the document.
Generative Answering: The LLM (LLaMA 3.2) uses RAG to generate context-aware responses that align closely with the retrieved data.

Why "Pdf Aether"?
The term "Aether" historically refers to the pure, upper atmosphere and symbolizes clarity and insight. Pdf Aether embodies this concept, transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights.
